## The Paper

Ballagas et al. [1] developed two complementary camera-based interaction techniques called point & shoot based on optical sensing and sweep based on optical-flow detection. Both techniques can be used for pointing, for example, to control a cursor on a large display. Point & shoot is used for absolute cursor positioning, while sweep realizes relative cursor movement.

### Sweep

### Point & Shoot

## Our Motivation

We were captivated by the concept of utilizing a smartphone as a mouse controller, particularly due to the intriguing prospect of implementing control through DIPPID. The study conducted by Ballagas et al. [1] in 2005 showcased the early stages of this interaction technique, albeit with limited options at the time. In order to carry out the study, an external and cumbersome accelerometer had to be attached.

Nowadays, even smartphones in the lower price range come equipped with at least one built-in accelerometer. Moreover, there are additional sensors that provide data on gyroscope and angles, among other things. The DIPPID functionality utilized in this course proves to be highly suitable for expanding upon and implementing the approach outlined in the paper. On one hand, the DIPPID app facilitates effortless acquisition and processing of data from various sensors. On the other hand, the inclusion of four buttons enables mouse button control and the incorporation of practical features related to mouse manipulation.

## Our Goal

Our objective consisted of two phases:

1) Enabling the user to control the mouse on the screen using a smartphone. This includes controlling the mouse cursor as well as the left and right mouse buttons. For this purpose, we utilized the accelerometer data from the smartphone and the values of the four buttons (1 = clicked/pressed, 0 = not clicked/released) obtained through the DIPPID application.

2) Implementation of features that we deemed useful and could be realized through this interaction technique.

## Mouse Control

### Interaction Device
Can be used via Smartphone or M5Stack

In theory, any device that can be lifted/rotated/moved, equipped with an accelerometer sensor and compatible with the DIPPID application can be used for interaction.

### Mouse Movement

## Gestures

To start recording a gesture hold button_3. The gestures are performed by "drawing" one of the predefined symbols with the mouse anywhere on the screen.

### Application Launcher

Similiar to a previous assignment, in a file called application.txt, paths to specific applications can be added. The name of the gesture in front of a path represent the corresponding gesture that launches the file. These gestures can also be changed if needed. It's important that the name of the gesture corresponds to a defined gesture in the file called gestures_enum.py.
