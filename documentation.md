## The Paper

Ballagas et al. [1] developed two complementary camera-based interaction techniques called point & shoot based on optical sensing and sweep based on optical-flow detection. Both techniques can be used for pointing, for example, to control a cursor on a large display. Point & shoot is used for absolute cursor positioning, while sweep realizes relative cursor movement.
